# CrewAI - A framework that lets us define "crews" of Agents
# These Agents work together to accomplish complex multi-step processes.

# Defined in this service:
    # Tools - functions an Agent can use
    # Agents - the entities that performs Tasks
    # Tasks - specific processes assigned to an Agent
    # Crew - the group of Agents we invoke to accomplish a goal
